# my_Project_
This Repository will delve into the essential components of compiler design by constructing a Lexical Analyzer and a Syntax Parser.
Instructions available in 
# Develop Lexical and Syntax Analyzer capable of parsing a source code file provided by the user via command line
# Using the lexical analyzer developed, design a recursive descent syntax parser in C++ that can validate the syntax of a source code file provided by the user.
