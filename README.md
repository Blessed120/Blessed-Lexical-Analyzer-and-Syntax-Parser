# Lexical Analyzer and Syntax Parser

## Overview

This project is a compiler front-end built in C++ that performs lexical analysis and syntax parsing using recursive descent. It demonstrates the foundational stages of compiler design â€” tokenizing source code and verifying its syntactic structure.

## Features

- **Lexical Analyzer**  
  Scans the input source code to identify tokens such as identifiers, keywords, operators, literals, and punctuation.

- **Syntax Parser**  
  Implements a recursive descent parser to validate whether the token stream conforms to the grammar rules of the language.

- **Error Handling**  
  Detects lexical and syntax errors with informative messages to help identify issues in the input source code.

## Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Blessed120/Blessed-Lexical-Analyzer-and-Syntax-Parser.git
   cd Blessed-Lexical-Analyzer-and-Syntax-Parser
